SQL Query Explanation
This query calculates the top 2 markets by gross sales in each region for fiscal year 2021. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. First CTE (etl1)
Joins fact_sales_monthly (aliased as s) with fact_gross_price (aliased as p)

Matches records on product_code and fiscal_year

Calculates total_gross_sales by multiplying sold_quantity by gross_price

2. Second CTE (cte2)
Joins the results from etl1 with dim_customer (aliased as c)

Filters for only fiscal year 2021

Groups by market, region, and fiscal year

Calculates the sum of gross sales (converted to millions and rounded to 2 decimal places)

3. Third CTE (cte3)
Takes the results from cte2

Uses DENSE_RANK() to rank markets within each region by gross sales (highest sales = rank 1)

The ranking is partitioned by region so each region gets its own ranking

Final Output
Selects all columns from cte3

Filters to only include the top 2 ranked markets in each region (where rn <= 2)

Orders the results by region and then by rank

Summary
This query identifies the top 2 performing markets (by gross sales) within each region for fiscal year 2021, showing the market name, region, fiscal year, gross sales amount in millions, and their rank within the region.
